    "# Homework 11 Programming - Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook we take a first look at hypothesis testing. First introduced by statistician Ronald Fisher ([read the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher)), hypothesis testing is a way to decide the validity of a hypothesis that is held to be true (*null hypothesis*) over an *alternative hypothesis*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A company develops a new drug to treat a liver disease. The drug that is currently in use has a success rate of \n",
    "55%, i.e. every patient being treated would recover independently of others with probability 0.55. The manufacturer of the drug claims the new drug is more effective. Let $p$ be the probability with which a patient being treated with the new drug would recover. Consider the following null and alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Null hypothesis*: The new drug works with the same probability as the old one (p=0.55),\n",
    "- *Alternative hypothesis*: The new drug works better than the old one, just like the company claims (p >0.55).\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to determine whether the company's claim is true. Note that there are two types of errors we could make in our judgement. We may either reject the null hypothesis, when in fact it is true, or we may accept the null hypothesis, when in fact it is false. These two types of error are called *type 1 error* and *type 2 error* respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test the company's hypothesis, MGH runs a trial, and tests the new drug on $n$ patients, and rejects the null hypothesis if the number of patients that recover is greater than or equal some number $m$ satisfying $1 \\leq m \\leq n$. Note that the number of patients that recovers is a binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ and hence, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, as a function of $p$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$    p_{reject} (p) =  \\sum_{m \\leq k \\leq n} \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One should convince themselves that $p_{reject}(0.55)$ is the probability of making a type 1 error (given that the *null hypothesis* is true), and that increasing $m$ makes this quantity smaller. Intuitively, the more people we require to recover, in order to decide that the new drug is an improvement, the less likely we are that we will come to that conclusion. Therefore we would like to choose $m$ large enough to make $p_{reject}(0.55)$ small.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the new drug is not more effective than the old one, we would like for the test to pass (and the for the *null hypothesis* to be confirmed). Since the probability of the test passing, is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p_{pass}(p) = 1- p_{reject}(p)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "it decreases as we increase the value of $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, increasing the value of $m$, increases the chance of *type 2 error*, while decreasing the value of $m$ increases the chance of *type 1 error*.\n"
